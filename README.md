-------Overview of the Project------

Project: WEATHER MONITORING STATION

Objective: Build a weather monitoring station using IoT sensors to collect data on
temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Display the collected data in
real-time on a dashboard or mobile app.

Description: An IoT-based weather monitoring station collects and transmits environmental data using various sensors connected to an Arduino board. This data can be accessed remotely in real-time through an IoT platform like Tinkercad.

Components:
Arduino Board: Central unit for processing data.
Sensors:
Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT22): Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
Barometric Pressure Sensor (e.g., BMP180): Measures atmospheric pressure.
Air Quality Sensor (e.g., MQ135): Detects air pollutants.
Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266): Connects the Arduino to the internet.
IoT Platform (e.g., ThingSpeak): Displays and stores data.
Tinkercad: Used for designing and simulating the circuit.


Functionality:
Data Collection: Sensors gather data on temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, and air quality.
Data Processing: Arduino processes the collected data.
Data Transmission: Wi-Fi module sends the data to an IoT platform.
Data Visualization: IoT platform displays real-time data.
